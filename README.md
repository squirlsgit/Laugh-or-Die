Game made for GGJ 2024

<code>You are captured by Mee!
Entertain Mee, with a knife to jab your fingers. The more pain, the more happy Mee will be.
Be careful, the more blood you lose, the closer you are to death. Cauterize your wound with the Bunsen burner to stop the bleeding.
Your victory comes when you entertain Mee enough and manage to kill him with his gun.
Don't sit still too long, Mee won't be too happy and may end your journey shortly.
